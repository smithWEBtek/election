Full Stack Developer Technical Challenge

The technical design challenge is below. It will be due at 10 a.m. on Monday January 21st. Please note that we do not expect applicants to fully complete this in the four hour time limit (though kudos to you if you manage to do so), so just take it as far as you can and we will evaluate the work you have done towards your solution and discuss any challenges you had in the technical interview.

Technical Design Challenge: Election Vote Preference Tool

You are a software developer with a presidential campaign. The campaign manager has asked you to build an application that allows a user to identify their home address on a map and submit information on whether they support or oppose your candidate. The user should be able to click a map point or alternatively type in an address and have it geocoded. The app should store this information in a Postgres database. The campaign manager would also like a map view that shows all the voters that submitted answers and whether they support or oppose the candidate so they can easily ascertain the state of their campaign.

You should use git to track your work in a repo that is accessible to us. You may choose to host your solution on GitHub pages or another web server so we can view the final result.

Your solution will be evaluated on the following criteria:
• code quality
• performance
• clarity and documentation (how easy is it for another developer to understand what you did)

You may document any assumptions you make in your commit messages or code comments. You should not spend more than 4 hours on this task.
